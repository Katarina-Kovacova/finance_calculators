HyperionDev Software Bootcamp Capstone project

Program allows the user to access two different financial calculators: An investment calculator and a home loan repayment calculator. 
The user is allowed to choose which calculation they want to use. 
To calculate the interest, the user is asked to input various data (the deposited amount, interest rate, number of years they planning to invest).
The user can choose to calculate either simple or compound interest. 
Based on user's choice, the app will return either simple or compound interest.
If the user chooses to calculate home loan repayments, the app will calculate the monthly repayments amount based on user's input (present value of the house, interest rate, number of months they plan to repay the loan).
